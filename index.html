      content="Voxels was founded in 2020 as Legal Person by Gabriel Hoffmann as a games service provider. In 2022 it became a Limited Company with the entry of two more partners, Rafael Rossi and Flavio Ribeiro, so we made the first version of our Endless Chase game project, which was presented at BGS/2022."

      content="From an early age, games have been our main form of entertainment. We love them so much that we decided to create our own and share our joy with other gamers. Our products are the result of our experience playing a variety of styles, seeking to bring out the best in our experiences. Our contagious dream became a reality and our own families believed and invested, helping us to produce the Demo of our first game."
